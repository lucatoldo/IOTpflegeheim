# IOT Pflegeheim
This repository contains documentation, software and hardware description to increase the efficiency of Nurse Homes (Pflegeheim)
through reduction of the manual effort required to document the activities of the Nurseplan (Pflegeplan).
This is achieved by
- IOT technology that automatically loads activity into a central database
- IOT reporting that automatically generates reports / views for different purposes

The initial implementation covers:
- wake up from bed
- measurement of blood pressure
- morning hygienic support
- breakfast
  - quality of the delivery
  - amount of food taken
